# ðŸ‘‹ About Me

I am a Senior Software Developer. Currently I lead two teams - one specialising in Java and one in C#.

I've coded professionally for 16+ years (and unprofessionally for nearly 40 years ðŸ˜…) so I'm comfortable in any language, but my strongest skills include:

Outside of coding, I'm also the author of [ðŸ“š two books](https://walkingoncustard.com/books) and a [ðŸŽ¤ comedian/mental health advocate](https://bit.ly/custardTED)

# Preferred Tech Stacks

ðŸ¤” On large projects, I enjoy strongly-typed languages the most, especially **C#** or **TypeScript**.

But it's also fun to work with **JavaScript** or **Python**.

Or, then again, it's always a treat to have an excuse to pick up a new language...
