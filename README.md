# 👋 About Me

I am a Senior Software Developer and team leader.

I'm also the author of [two books](https://walkingoncustard.com/books) and a [comedian/mental health advocate](https://bit.ly/custardTED)

I've coded professionally for 16+ years (and unprofessionally for nearly 40 years 😅) so I'm comfortable in any language, but my strongest skills include:

# Preferred Tech Stacks

On large projects, I enjoy strongly-typed languages the most, especially **C#** or **TypeScript**. But it's also fun to work with **JavaScript** or **Python**. Then again, it's always a treat to have an excuse to pick up a new language...
